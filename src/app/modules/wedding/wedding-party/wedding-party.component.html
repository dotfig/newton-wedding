                        I have known Pepper my whole life and he is my best friend in the world. We grew up in New
                        Mexico
                        playing guns, dressing up like girls (his idea), and just making the most of the time we had
                        together. I lived with Pepper after college for 2 years and it was such an amazing experience
                        having
                        my childhood friend as a roommate when I was an adult. If you see him at the wedding make sure
                        to
                        ask him why he is my best man.
                    </p>

                        I have never in my life met someone that can make me laugh like Warren and at the same time want
                        to
                        kill him a minute later. His humor is unmatched and very unusual. Warren and I shared a room for
                        2
                        years. We even had a bathroom with his and her sinks. I have not known Warren very long but I
                        know
                        he will be a life long friend. Ask Warren about his financial planning robot. It is sick!

                        Pat was my closest friend in high school. We did everything together; soccer, basketball, track,
                        worked at the same restaurant, and I even drove him home from school most days. Patrick would
                        come
                        over so much that my Dad would put him to work on chores around the house. We even roomed with
                        each
                        other my freshman year of college. He always has a great attitude and is so much fun to be
                        around. I
                        love him.

                        I love that Jeremy is competitive. He never made it easy for us to beat him at anything. Every
                        time
                        I go home I realize how much of a MAN my older brother is. He knows how to do soooo much manly
                        stuff. I am so proud of my older brother. He is the first one of my brothers to have child and
                        he is
                        an awesome daddy. He wont admit this but I am a way better ping pong player than him.

                        The Shiba Inu is the smallest of the six original and distinct spitz breeds of dog from Japan.
                        A small, agile dog that copes very well with mountainous terrain, the Shiba Inu was originally
                        bred for hunting.
